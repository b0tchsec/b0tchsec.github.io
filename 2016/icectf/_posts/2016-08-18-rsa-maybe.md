>John was messing with RSA again... he encrypted our flag! I have a strong feeling he had no idea what he was doing however, can you get the flag for us? [flag.txt](https://play.icec.tf/problem-static/flag_4c1049d07cfe1ea989e7fd8e3ff790aa58867989430ae7956b68ecf4f66432f2.txt) 

# Investigation 
The file we're provided lists N, E, and C. The thing that stands out the most is that E is only 0x01. Low values of E are frowned upon, but this one takes it to a new level.

# Solution
In RSA, when e is 0x01, we can simply convert the hex value we're given for the ciphertext (c) to ascii and get the flag.
