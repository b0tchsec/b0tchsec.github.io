UPDATE: We have made changes to this challenge to make it (somewhat) stable. If what you were trying before is not working, it's because it was causing a problem for us on the back end. I assure you that what you were doing was not the easiest solution, anyway.

We all love doggos and puppers. Have some more of one of our favorite puppers, Gabe. Bork.

# Investigation

If you post to /bork and try to grab a random file, say, flag.txt, it prints out an error

```
cat: borks/flag.txt: No such file or directory?autoplay=1&loop=1
```

This means it's taking our input and passing it to "cat". Can we abuse this to disclose other files? What about chain commands for command injection? It looks like when we try to do something not allowed we get presented with an error page

```

After some more testing, I found that some commands could be injected while others were being filtered. Things I couldn't seem to do include:

```
cat
find
ls
```

However, I was able to succeed by passing the following:

```

bork=$(grep -r '.' -e "RC3")
```

Which returned:

```


That looks like a flag to me!
