```

When connecting to this website in my browser, I receive the following prompt:

```
Welcome to Doctor Professor Wilson's Python 101!
Lesson 1: hello world
Enter homework for grading:
```

So it looks like this will execute the Python code you provide.  So I test it with the following:

```
Welcome to Doctor Professor Wilson's Python 101!
Lesson 1: hello world
Enter homework for grading:
print('Hello world')
Hello world
```

And then it immediately closes the connection.  So it looks like it only allows a single line of Python code.

I then decide to try and dump the working directory file contents.  This can be done with `os.listdir('.')`, however, this would require a call to `import os`.  Unfortunately, it appears some or all imports are blocked, as an error was returned.  So instead, I decide to just guess that there exists a file either called `flag.txt` or `flag` in the working directory, and luckily, opening and reading files doesn't require any imports.  So I construct a one-liner to do just that: `print(open('flag.txt','r').read())`.

```
