**Points:** 200

**Description:**

```
A customer suspects that his email account is being targeted to be hacked. He has asked you to investigate and trace his attacker's real name (flag).

During your talk, he mentioned a suspicious email that he received about a bank transfer from someone he doesn't know. He actually tried to investigate by himself and found out the email was crafted to hide the real sender. He was able to go as far as finding a related facebook account by adding "tmctf" to the name he found from the email and that was as far as he got. Unfortunately he deleted the email after this, thinking it was just a random phishing email. He provided you with pcap logs from his machine to start your investigation.

> unzip files18.zip
```

# Investigation
Let's start by issuing a `unzip pcap_record.zip`. Loading up the pcap in wireshark, you can filter for `pop` and look at mail. 

Looking through the mail packets, we can see this `tcp.stream eq 307` looks interesting. Let's follow that.

We're told that there's a facebook page related, so let's search for `mario dboro tmctf` on facebook.

From here we can see he belongs to `tmctfcommunity`, so let's message that page and see what happens.

"Thanks for messaging us. You are half way in your challenge. In order to proceed, you need to find the magic string "854FJD922KA" in social media post. Goodluck!"

I searched facebook for this string with no luck. So I took to twitter, my favorite social media network. I made the following google query: `site:twitter.com "854FJD922KA"`, which yielded `https://twitter.com/dboro18673`.

There were many tweets that were possibly interesting here, and I'll let you know that I certainly exhausted every single one of those links.

After like 2 hours of banging my head against the keyboard, I realized that I hadn't seen any linkedin yet tonight, and so I took to linkedin.
