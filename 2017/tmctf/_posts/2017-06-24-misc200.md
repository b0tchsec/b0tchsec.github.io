**Category:** Misc

**Points:** 200

**Description:**

```
A scenario of Pokemon Go hacking has been circulating in the internet. It is reported that the attacker is riding on the upcoming Pokemon Go summer events. The attacker has crafted a socially engineered email containing a message that promises to instantly get a random Legendary Pokemon in their Pokemon Go account if the user clicked on the link and then register their Pokemon Go username and password.

Based from previous investigations, it was found that the attacker was saving all collected information in his email account. Given a sample of the malicious email, your team is tasked to find the password (flag) of the attacker's email account. The password is located in one of his website, thus requiring you to use your OSINT investigation skills.

Hint:
1. Find the attacker's domain using the mail sample. 
2. Then, you need to find his real name in one of his social media account. 
3. Finally, the path is posted in one of his social media accounts.

# Note:
I wasted many hours hunting down [@Tyage](https://twitter.com/tyage) when he registered `pokemongolegendaryclaim.com`. It was almost like a little mini-ctf on the side, except it just slowed me down from getting the actual answer. Well played, [binja](https://ctftime.org/team/9083).

# Investigation
When we look at the email in this pcap, we see a number of interesting things that I quickly took note of:

**Domains of potential interest:**

 * skyreward.net
 * pokemongolegendaryclaim.com

**Emails of interest:**

 * pokemon@skyreward.net
 * sloskovomaravitsky@yahoo.com

I started hunting down what I thought of right away and ruled out either email address possessing a facebook, twitter, myspace, linkedin, or gmail account.

I checked the whois on both `skyreward.net` and `pokemongolegendaryclaim.com` and didn't think much else.

I checked the http headers for both websites, and this is where I should have noticed the binja trickery, when I got this response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.11.9
Date: Sat, 24 Jun 2017 11:42:16 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 173
Last-Modified: Sat, 24 Jun 2017 06:10:51 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: 594e026b-ad
X-MESSAGE: HELLO TMCTF, we sell this domain 10,000 JPY!
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```

I ended up doing a `traceroute www.pokemongolegendaryclaim.com` which led to `160.16.226.39`, which called itself `mocos.kitchen`

**You can spend some time following this rabbit hole if you want, but I'll tell you now that it does not lead to the flag.**

## Oops, let's get back on track

Using the email address provided `sloskovomaravitsky@yahoo.com`, and the hunting on tyage's webpages that I did, I decided I should also check flickr, lo and behold he had an account.
```

```

Using the name provided here, `Manolito Taburnek`, let's search google and Google Plus. This led to the following links:

```
Maybe this g+
https://plus.google.com/101710284495299138820

Maybe this one, they are both suspicious
https://plus.google.com/108586041295363265969

http://hedgehug2014.info/
125.212.43.55

$ whois hedgehug2014.info
[...]
manolito_taburnek@yahoo.com
```

A little hunting pointed me to `hedgehog2014.info` as another domain owned by Manolito_taburnek@yahoo.com.

From here, I took the second google plus account I saw, where all the random pictures were being posted with letters, and I tried each of those letters as subdomains against `hedgehog2014.info`. This did not yield anything, but it was worth a shot.

Finally, I take those same sets of letters and try them as urls after the `.info`

By the third one I looked at, I was rewarded with the flag. `http://hedgehog2014.info/LDFGDSKLGS332`
